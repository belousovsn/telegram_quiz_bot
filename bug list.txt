Bug list:
1. I shouldn't be able to start round while current round is active
    this applies only to current context - be it personal chat or channel chat
2. /stop should stop current round 
    applies to both waiting for the answer period and waiting for the next question to be asked
3. User nickname should be displayed instead of userId when you announce correctly answered users. 
4. Pre-conditions: user_1 started the round by /start command, the first question is asked
    Steps to reproduce:
        1) user_1 answered the first question correctly
        2) user_1 used /start command
        3) time for the question is up
    Expected result:
        1) user_1 got the point for the question
        2) The message is shown with user_1 mentioned in it: "Users that answered correctly: user_1_name"
